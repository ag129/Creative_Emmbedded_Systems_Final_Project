# Creative_Emmbedded_Systems_Final_Project

This projeect is an interactive kinetic sculpture. The sculpture is of two kids in a park being pushed by an adult on a playground carousel. It is inspired by my memories of playing in the playground carousel with my sister and my aunt.
The hardware used in this project was a a 28BYJ-48 Step Motor, and a servo motor that has a 180 degree range of motion, a potentiometer, an ESP32 TTGO T-display, and a laptop. The stepper motor powered the carousel. It was a good choice to power the carousel because it is a motor that allows for fine control of its motion, allowing the carousel speed to be adjusted, and since it rotates 360 degrees as the carousel to rotate continuously in a circle. My aunt's pushing motion was powered by the figurine being attached to the servo motor. The servo motor worked well for this because it allowed for precise control over where the starting and ending points of the figurine for each push were. This allowed me to make there be a larger change in position from the start to end of the push to communicate a harder push of the carousel. The potentiometer was a good choice for inputting the selection of speed because it allowed the user to input a range of values for the speed. The potentiometer reading was converted into 1 of 14 speed settings, which I found was a sufficient number to make a satisfying gradient from the stopped position to high speeds.
The ESP32 and laptop worked well for controlling and powering the device. The ESP32 was connected to the laptop via a wire. This was good because the computer provides a large power supply to the esp32 to power the motors, and for a longer display time can be charging while also plugged in to the ESP32. It was also useful because it allowed me to have the code print the potentiometer input in the serial monitor. This was useful because if the sculpture wasn't functioning as expected after its been moved and set up it was easy to troubleshoot because I had the data printing.
The sculpture also features a 3D printed carousel and 3D printed figurines and an enclosure made of foam board, decorated with markers to look like a park. The enclosure has one open side and an open bottom in order to allow easy access to the wiring, in order to plug in the computer and adjust any wires as necessary.
The code for my sculpture was tricky due to working out the timing of different tasks and actions. I ended up deciding to read the potentiometer every 1/8 of a rotation of the carousel, or after a delay(1000) if the carousel was stopped. I would then adjust the carousel speed according to the readings. Every 1/8th of a turn the adult figurine would pivot either forwards or backwards, alternating between the two. Every time it was about to moved forward, how far forwards it pivoted was determined by the speed, with a larger pivot and therefore a larger "push" at faster speeds. I chose to have the interval be 1/8th of a carousel rotation for each movement so that every forth of a rotation of the carousel there was a push forward. Since there are four handles on the carousel, it gives the illusion that the figurine representing my aunt is pushing every time a handle passes for her to push.
